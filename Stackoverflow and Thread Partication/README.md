Final Course Project Description
================================

Predicting link formation in online settings is one of the most critical
tasks data scientists have to deal with. In fact, link formation dynamics
help to solve several business problems, such as:

+ explaining the popularity of products in online marketplaces
+ building recommender systems (see last year final course project)
+ placing ads (e.g., ads concerning job posts) in the right spot so as
  to maximise the returns and attract more 'customers'

For this final course project, groups are required to analyze the Stackoverflow
setting and to address the following question: Why do users participate in certain
threads â€“ i.e., reply to certain questions?
